Hi, I'm Hao Yan, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Carleton University, working under the supervision of [Dr. Yuhong Guo](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~yuhongguo/index.html) at the [AIML Lab](https://aiml.carleton.ca/). My PhD thesis centers on cross-domain model adaptation and generalization.
