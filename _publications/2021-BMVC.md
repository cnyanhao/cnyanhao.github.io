Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation aims to learn a model that generalizes
well on a target domain given the pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Traditional unsupervised domain adaptation methods are mostly not applicable to this
setting since no source data are available. To tackle this problem, we propose to generate
labeled surrogate source training data from the source model by fixing the model and optimizing the inputs. To avoid naive local fittings to individual instances and in light of the
model optimization process, we further enforce model gradient based global fitting constraints on the whole dataset generation and solve the formulated optimization problem
using an ADMM algorithm. The generated labeled source training data can then be used
to deploy existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods. Furthermore, we propose
to incorporate the unlabeled target data into the domain adaptation process to improve
generalization in the target domain with a mutual information loss. Experiments show
that our proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
